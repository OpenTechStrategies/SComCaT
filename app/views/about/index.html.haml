      SComCat comprises a catalogue (knowledge base) of scholarly communications open technologies where the term "technologies" is defined to include software and some essential running services. The aim is to assist potential users in making decisions about which technologies they will adopt by providing an overview of the functionality, organizational models, dependencies, use of standards, and levels of adoption of each technology.
    %p
      The scan includes tools, platforms, and standards that can be locally adopted to support one or more of functions of the lifecycle of scholarly communications, which is conceptualized as including the following activities: creation, evaluation, publication, dissemination, preservation, and reuse.
    %p
      We envision this scan as being extensible over time in order to address the evolving needs of various communities.
